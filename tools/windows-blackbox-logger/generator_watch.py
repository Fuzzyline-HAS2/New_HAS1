"""Generator silence and crash-reboot detection from data the collector already has.

The game server records every generator request, and generators poll Loop every
2 s whether or not a game runs (failures back off to about 8 s). A generator that
sends nothing for 20 s during a game is reported. The watch clock is the newest
request from ANY device, so a stalled server or telemetry log stops the clock
instead of making every generator look silent; after such a pause, silence is
measured again from the moment requests resume. Several generators going silent
together are reported as one group, since they share a cause (seen as one Wi-Fi
drop of all five in Omada DHCP logs). A generator no game uses (the academy's AG) can
be watched always instead: its silence is reported on its own, game or not, and neither a
game end nor a server restart ends it.

Crash reboots recover within seconds and leave no request gap; they come from the
generator's own blackbox Boot record. This module only decides; the incident
store persists and notifies. It holds no clock of its own, so replaying a log
yields the same decisions.
